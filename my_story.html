        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>My name is Dakodah Bradley. <br />I am 29 turning 30 this year.<br />I am the oldest of 7 kids.<br /></p>
        <pre style="font-size: large;">
            I just left a job of 10 years to do this program. I worked my way up to Director of Operations at Arrowhead Forenics. It was 
            a fun place to work, but I felt I had hit the ceiling there and I am not ready to stop learning and trying to improve myself. 
            I am involved with my chuch, Ascend Chuch, in Kansas City. I have been attending Ascend for around 10-11 years now and have made
            a lot of great friends and mentors along the way who are very supportive. 
            I am looking forward to this new challenge and sharing this experience with whoever will have me! Thank you!
